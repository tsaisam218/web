        Cher Wang is one of the very first women in history to establish a
        start-up technology business. At first, Cher Wang focused on technology entrepreneurship,
        wherein she founded her first company, VIA Technologies,
        in 1987. Here she sold motherboards chips, memories, and CPUs.
        However, Wang's dream was to give the world a handheld device capable
        of the computer's power while being portable.
        Therefore, Wang co-founded HTC in 1997 in New Taipei City, Taiwan,
        and this dream was realised as the company has been innovating masterful
        technology ever since its foundation.
